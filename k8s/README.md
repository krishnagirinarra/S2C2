To launch the deployments and services to the k8s cluster, install the "kubernetes" API package for python3. 

Notes:
1. Check out the "write_coded_deployment_specs.py" and see what environment variables are passed to your own docker containers on bootup.
2. Check out the "write_coded_service_specs.py" and see what are the opened ports for communications.
3. To launch, do "python3 k8s_coding.py" from this directory.
